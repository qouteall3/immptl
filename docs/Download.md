## How to Install This Mod (Fabric version)

1. [Install Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/player:tutorials:install_mcl:windows)
2. Open the game directory, find the `mods` folder, put the mod jar into `mods` folder. (If `mods` folder does not exist, launch the game with Fabric once and the folder will be created.)
3. Download Fabric API (from [GitHub](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/releases) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)), put Fabric API mod jar into `mods` folder. (Fabric API is a mod. Fabric API is not Fabric loader)
